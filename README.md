## Overview

This repository contains two projects developed for the Multispectral Remote Sensing class. The main project involves using machine learning algorithms to classify land use in a region southeast of Lisbon, based on **Sentinel-2** multispectral data. A smaller project analyzes an article about the use of deep convolutional neural networks for land use classification with high spatial resolution multispectral imagery.

## Projects

### 1. Machine Learning Land Use Classification (Project1)

- **Objective**: The goal of this project was to classify land use in a section of Portugal southeast of Lisbon using **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - **Random Forest (RF)**: Uses 200 decision trees for classification based on majority voting.
  - **Decision Trees**: Non-parametric algorithm based on hierarchical if/else questions with a tree having 10 branches.
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' Theorem assuming strong independence between features.

- **Image Data**:
  - Includes spectral **bands**, **indices**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** components, and **textures** to improve classification accuracy.
  - Band combinations tested: 
    1. Bands only
    2. Bands + Indices
    3. Bands + Indices + Textures

- **Results**:
  - The best overall accuracy (83%) was obtained using **Naive Bayes** with bands only.
  - **Random Forest** performed well, but excluding underrepresented classes like class 323 (Other Conifers) improved results slightly.
  - **Decision Trees** had a lower accuracy compared to Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
  
- **Limitations**:
  - The study's small area size limited the ability to generalize the models for all land use classes.
  - High computational effort constrained the choice of algorithms, preventing the use of **SVM** and **KNN**.

### 2. Article Analysis on Land Use Classification (Project2)

- **Objective**: Analyze an academic article focused on the application of machine learning or neural networks for land use classification using multispectral images.
  
- **Article**: "Urban land-use mapping using a deep convolutional neural network with high spatial resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery" by Bo Huang, Bei Zhao, and Yimeng Song.  
- **Methodology**: The project involved critically analyzing the methodology, results, and challenges presented in the paper.
  
- **Deliverables**:
  - **Analysis Report**: A detailed written review of the article.
  - **Presentation**: Summarizes key findings and insights from the article analysis.
